# AVSBG
A very simple board game. Disclaimer: It is not the most excellent design/organization of code and evolved very quickly. 

# Start
Simply clone the repo and open index.html in a browser.

# About
I created this years ago to learn Javascript better. I've moved to Github and want to get my projects over. I wanted to move this to TypeScript with a proper backend and use web sockets or Pusher to make it multiplayer, but I deprioritized the idea.
