# AVSBG
A very simple board game.

# Play
[http://games.bobby-gaylor.com/avsbg/](http://games.bobby-gaylor.com/avsbg/)

# Start
Simply clone the repo and open index.html in a browser.

# About
I created this years ago to better learn Javascript. I've moved to Github and want to get my projects over. I would eventually like to get around to moving this to TypeScript with a proper backend and using web sockets or Pusher to make it multiplayer. When time permits I guess. 

# Release Notes
Release notes can be found [here](RELEASENOTES.md).
